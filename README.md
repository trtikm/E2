The project attempts to create a *parametrised model* of a neural tissue
(with the main focus on the cerebral cortex of the human brain) such that there
are concrete values for parameters for which the corresponding instance of
the model has the property that adaptability of the model to rules of a given
environment emerges during its simulation.

Since the set of concrete values for parameters will be large, an important part
of the project is designing of many concrete simulation experiments which
will effectively exclude many useless combination of values for parameters.
Each experiment will provide its own measure of adaptability in term of resource
consumption by agent controlled by the models of tissue.

The parametrised model should be ready in August 2016. The subsequent search
for the right combination of concrete values for parameters will take longer,
about three years. Therefore, we can expect the results in August 2019.
