We provide an implementation and experimental evaluation (simulation) of many models
of the neural tissue constructed for different properties and parameters in order to classify
the models according to their adaptability to conditions in diverse environments.
The goal of the project is to discover an influence of mentioned properties and
parameters to the adaptability.

The project's documentation (including the installation guide for all supported platforms)
is available [here](https://rawgit.com/trtikm/E2/master/index.html).
