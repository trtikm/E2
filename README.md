UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

The source code is not functional yet. The first stable release is planed to
August 2015.

The project attempts to create a *parametrised model* of a neural tissue
(with the main focus on the cerebral cortex of the human brain) such that there
are concrete values for parameters for which the corresponding instance of
the model has the property that intelligent behaviour emerges during its
simulation.

Since the set of concrete values for parameters will be large, an important part
of the project is designing of many concrete simulation experiments which
will effectively exclude many useless combination of values for parameters.
Each experiment will provide its own measure for intelligent behaviour. This
will involve (among other things) the comparison with results of human
individuals playing the experiment.

The parametrised model should be ready in August 2015. The subsequent search
for the right combination of concrete values for parameters will take much
longer, about five years. Therefore, we can expect the first results in
August 2020.
