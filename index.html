<h1>E2 project</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation and aims</h2>
<p>
An interesting and important ability of a neural tissue (especially of the
cerebral cortex) is its <em>adaptation</em> to conditions in the environment
in order to maximise (long term) options for its organism.
</p><p>
Although we have models for many important components and properties of neural tissue
[<a href="./index.html#r03">3</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r02">2</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r01">1</a>],
e.g. models of neurons (in many different levels of details), synapses and
synaptic plasticity, axon growth, layered structure of a micro column, etc., it
is unknown what models of neural tissue model the adaptability with what
accuracy. It is in particular unknown how the adaptability depends on model's
properties like number of neurons in a micro column, number of neurons in whole
model, in/out-degrees of neurons, distributions of excitatory and inhibitory
synapses, lengths of axons, strength of attraction and repulsion cues for axon
growth, numbers of sensory cells, number of output fibres (to models of
muscles), small-world phenomenon, power low distribution of in/out-degrees of
cells, and many others.
</p><p>
In this project we aim to fill this gap. Namely, we shall design, implement, and
experimentally evaluate (simulate) many models of neural tissue constructed for
different properties mentioned above in order to classify models according to
their adaptability and to uncover influence of mentioned properties to the
adaptability.
</p><p>
Of course, we cannot simulate models comparable in counts of neurons with the
cerebral cortex of mammals or birds due to lack of computational power.
Nevertheless, we may expect
that the adaptability can be observed also in substantially smaller neural
tissues (hundreds of thousands of neurons), when it has to adapt itself to
conditions of substantially simpler environments.
</p><p>
We shall thus also design and implement several simple environments, in which
individual agents, controlled by different models of neural tissue, harvest
available resources. A key part of the design of an environment is a correlation
between the adaptability to conditions of the environment and strategies for
harvesting resources.
</p><p>
In summary, our endeavour is supposed to give us the following three important
outputs (two theoretical and one practical):
<ul><li>
    <em>Classification</em> of models of neural tissue according to their
    adaptability to different environments.
</li><li>
    <em>Influence of properties</em> of models of neural tissue to the adaptability.
</li><li>
    <em>Evaluation framework</em> in which we shall perform all simulations.
</li></ul>
<p>
First two outputs give us a good estimate how accurate the current models of
neural tissue can be w.r.t. the adaptability to conditions of an environment.
Moreover, this knowledge can be very useful for a researcher designing a new
model: when it is known what properties are essential and which are not, the
researcher may save o lot of time in construction of a desired model. Futher, a
subsequent deep analysis of our outputs (e.g. why some properties are so
important) may lead to more accurate and simultaneously efficient models.
</p><p>
The evaluation framework allows other researches to verify our results.
Moreover, the previous two output can be easily extended in future using the
framework, since it suffices to only implement a new model and/or an environment
and plug it into the framework. Finally, the framework can be reused for study
of different properties of neural tissue. We simply plug in different kinds of
models and environments.
</p><p>
Although we now focus only on smaller models (due to limited available computational
power), all three outputs can naturally be updated over time (by us and/or other
researchers) for larger and larger models.
</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods and techniques</h2>
<p>
First of all we need a set of models of neural tissue to be examined. We shall
design and implement these models for wide ranges of properties mentioned above.
We shall also use different known models of components of neural tissue, like
different models of neurons, synapses, axon growth, etc. Although we shall
attempt to use models of different biological accuracy, our priority is
simulation of larger models (up to hundreds of thousands of neurons). So,
simpler models will be more preferable.
</p><p>
Besides models of neural tissue we further need models of environments. A model
of an environment is a simple game with a single goal for agents: to collect
resources. Agents are controlled by unique and independent models of neural tissue.
Here are examples of possible environments (games):
</p>
<table class="figure">
    <tr>
        <td> <img src="./doc/envSP.svg" alt="[envSP.svg]"> </td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td> <img src="./doc/envMPsim.svg" alt="[envMPsim.svg]"> </td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td> <img src="./doc/envMPadv.svg" alt="[envMPadv.svg]"> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
The game on the left is for one agent controlling the horisontal bar. Each time
the bar hits the ball the agent receives a bit of energy (resource). The other
two games are for more agents. The game in the middle requires cooperation of
both agent in order to maximise resources' consumption. And the game on the
right is competitive, where agents
<img src="./doc/agentMPadv.svg" alt="[agentMPadv.svg]">
compete for resources
<img src="./doc/flowerMPadv.svg" alt="[flowerMPadv.svg]">
(flowers).
</p><p>
A model of neural tissue receives information about the environment and all
agents in it via sensory cells. Information about resources collected by its
agent is delivered indirectly, by observation of capabilities of its agent
(e.g. the agent can move faster when he has more energy).
</p><p>
All games are intentionally very similar in design and the goal. Models of
neural tissue are supposed to show how they can adapt to their (slightly)
different rules. We measure the adaptability of models in terms of collected
resources by their agents.
</p><p>
The project has special requirements for the evaluation. We shall simulate
models of many different sizes (from few hundreds of neurons up to hundreds of
thousands of neurons per agent). Moreover, agent's model of neural tissue is
actually just one component in a bigger model of whole the environment (game).
We further require features like dynamical changes in connectivity between
neurons, simulation of axon growth, or keeping of network properties like power
law distribution of degrees of cells, etc. Therefore, although there are
available software packages providing simulation of models of a neural tissue,
e.g.
[<a href="./index.html#r08">8</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r07">7</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r04">4</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r05">5</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r06">6</a>],
they are not suitable for our purposes. We thus implement a new <em>evaluation
framework</em> which allows as to plug in many different models of neural tissue and
also allowing as to set and maintain network properties like small-world phenomenon,
power low distribution of in/out-degrees of cells, etc. Finally, the framework
will further allow us to plug in different environments and interconnect agents
with their models of neural tissue.
