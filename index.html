<h1>E2 project</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation and aims</h2>
<p>
An interesting and important ability of the mammalian cerebral cortex
[<a href="./index.html#r09">9</a>]
is its fast <em>adaptation</em> to conditions in the external environment
in order to maximise a number of short and long term options for
the whole organism.
</p><p>
We already have a lot of information about individual <em>components</em> of
the mammalian cerebral cortex, like neurons
[<a href="./index.html#r10">10</a>],
excitatory and inhibitory synapses with their plasticity
[<a href="./index.html#r11">11</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r13">13</a>],
axons and their growth
[<a href="./index.html#r12">12</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r13">13</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r14">14</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r15">15</a>]
according to strengths of attraction and repulsion cues
[<a href="./index.html#r23">23</a>,
 <a href="./index.html#r24">24</a>,
 <a href="./index.html#r25">25</a>,
 <a href="./index.html#r26">26</a>],
micro columns and their layered structure
[<a href="./index.html#r17">17</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r09">9</a>],
glia cells
[<a href="./index.html#r18">18</a>],
etc.
We also have models of many of these components
[<a href="./index.html#r03">3</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r02">2</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r01">1</a>]
with different degrees of biological accuracy
[<a href="./index.html#r19">19</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r20">20</a>,<a
    href="./index.html#r21">21</a>].
The mammalian cerebral cortex is basically a <em>network</em>
[<a href="./index.html#r22">22</a>]
of mutually interconnected neurons. An important role
thus also play <em>network properties</em>, like a number of neurons in a
micro column, a number of neurons in the whole cerebral cortex,
distribution of in/out-degrees of neurons, distributions of excitatory and
inhibitory synapses, a number of input and output fibres to and from the cortex,
the small-world phenomenon
[<a href="./index.html#r27">27</a>],
clustering coefficients of neurons
[<a href="./index.html#r28">28</a>],
and others.
</p><p>
Despite of all knowledge we already have, several key questions are still open.
Here we list three of them which are of the top importance for the E2 project:
</p>
<ul><li>
Do we have enough information to build a model of the mammalian cerebral
cortex such that the adaptation emerges during its simulation?
</li><li>
What are the key properties and components every model of the mammalian
cerebral cortex must necessarily have to achieve any observable degree
of adaptation during a simulation?
</li><li>
What components and properties we have to model in what biological details
in order to achieve what degree of adaptation?
</li></ul>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to contribute in the endeavour of answering
these questions.
</p>
<h2 id="methods">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods and techniques</h2>
<p>
Simply said, our method is brute force: we build and simulate as many
computer models of the mammalian cerebral cortex as possible (for many
different network properties and different biological details of individual
components) in order to find an evidence for answers to the questions
in the
<a href="./index.html#motivation">sections 1</a>
by a detailed analysis of data obtained from the simulations.
</p><p>
For that purpose we build a <em>parametrised</em> model of the mammalian
cerebral context. Its purpose is to save time needed for building individual models.
Instead of building each model from scratch, we just substitute parameters of
the parametrised model with concrete components and desired network properties.
We implemented the parametrised model in the E2 library
<a href="./doc/project_documentation/cellab/cellab.html"><kbd>cellab</kbd></a>,
and the E2 library
<a href="./doc/project_documentation/cellconnect/cellconnect.html"><kbd>cellconnect</kbd></a>
simplifies substitution of network properties into the parametrised model.
</p><p>
In order to measure a degree of adaptation of a computer model of the cerebral
cortex we always simulate it in a direct interaction with an <em>external
environment</em>. A computer model controls one unique <em>agent</em>
within the environment. In that context we address the computer model as a
<em>controller</em> of the agent. There can be more than one agent in an environment.
In that case there is the same number of controllers (for each agent one)
interacting with the environment during the simulation. Here are three examples
of archetypal external environments:
</p>
<table class="figure">
    <tr>
        <td> <img src="./doc/envSP.svg" alt="[envSP.svg]"> </td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td> <img src="./doc/envMPsim.svg" alt="[envMPsim.svg]"> </td>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td> <img src="./doc/envMPadv.svg" alt="[envMPadv.svg]"> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
The environment on the left is for one agent (the horisontal bar).
Its horisontal motion can prevent the moving black point (the ball) to
escape from the field. Other two environments are for more agents.
The environment in the middle requires a cooperation of agents (vertical
bars) to keep the ball inside the field. And the environment on the
right is competitive, where agents
<img src="./doc/agentMPadv.svg" alt="[agentMPadv.svg]">
compete for resources
<img src="./doc/flowerMPadv.svg" alt="[flowerMPadv.svg]">
(flowers). Agents are supposed to establish and guard their territories of flowers.
</p><p>
During a simulation of an external environment with controllers of agents
we record states of individual agents (like positions,
velocities, etc.) and later we analyse the recorded data
in order to infer degrees of adaptability of individual controllers.
We do not consider internal states of controllers in computation
of their adaptability. We treat controllers, in this context,
as black boxes.
</p><p>
It is not easy, in general, to specify an accurate measure
of adaptability for an agent in an external environment. Even for
extremely simple environments like the leftmost environment above the
task is not easy. The agent in this environment has the highest number
of options for what to do, whenever the agent is at a position from
which it is possible to reach and hit the ball before it gets to the
bottom side of the field. We may thus consider as an accurate
measure an increasing occurrence of the agent at such positions as
the simulation progresses. Nevertheless, this measure does not take
into account a situation when agent's strategy is to stay forever at
one randomly chosen position, which may accidentally be a position which
"locks" the ball in the field, i.e. the ball always returns back to that
position.
</p><p>
Fortunately, it is not necessary for us to have an accurate measure
capturing all scenarios which may possibly happen a given environment.
It is sufficient if we have a measure which is accurate only over all
recorded data we have for that environment. So, we first perform
all simulations of the environment (at least one simulation for each
combination of controllers we want to evaluate in that environment).
Next we analyse all recorded data (from all simulations). This may involve
building visualisations of data, like replays of simulations,
application of statistical methods, and so on. The outcome from the analysis
is a measure of adaptability, which is accurate only over
all recorded data (from all simulations). Finally, we apply the measure
to all recorded data to get degrees of adaptability for all controllers
used in simulations.
</p><p>
We can build tens or hundreds of computer models of the mammalian cerebral
cortex for different network properties and biological details
of components. Each model can further be simulated in interaction
with different external environments. So, the number of simulations
we may possibly perform is high. Yet, at the beginning, each simulation
can potentially give us an important piece of missing information.
In any case, to perform all simulations will either cost us extremely
high computational resources or very long time.
For example, if an average speed of a simulation is one tenth of the
speed of a modelled (real) mammalian cerebral cortex, then 250 simulations
of one week of life, performed in a sequence, will take almost 48 years.
<!--Note that our estimate of the ten times slower speed is actually quite-->
<!--optimistic. The simulation of cat's brain on the Blue Gene super computer-->
<!--in 20?? ran 100 times slower that real cat's brain. -->
</p><p>
Therefore, rather than performing all possible simulations we incrementally
build our knowledge (from already performed simulations and analyses of
recorded data) about what network properties and what biological details
of what components are more important (with the respect to adaptability)
than others. The knowledge allows us to avoid construction and simulation
of less promising models for obtaining an important information. This
strategy is supposed to give us (at the end) a maximum of valuable information
with the respect to the limited computational and time resources.
</p><p>
All external environments we build and use in this project are implemented
in the E2 library
<a href="./doc/project_documentation/envlab/envlab.html"><kbd>envlab</kbd></a>.
And the E2 library
<a href="./doc/project_documentation/efloop/efloop.html"><kbd>efloop</kbd></a>
mediates the interaction between an external environments and controllers of
agents.
