<h1>E2: cellconnect</h1>
<p>
This module provides algorithms which are able to <em>set-up</em> synapses between cells in
a neural tissue s.t. the resulting tissue has some desired <em>network properties</em>.
It means that here we consider a neural tissue to be a network (graph) with cells
representing nodes and synapses representing links (edges). A network property is
then any property we can tell about a network from the point of view of the graph/network
theory. Here we primarily focus on the following very important
network properties: small-world property, power-law distribution of in/out-degrees
of cells (i.e. is the network scale-free), and clustering coefficients of cells.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Number of cells in a neural tissue can be quite large. An exact specification of
connections between cells requires a space comparable with the size of the tissue
itself (remember that number of synapses is dominant in any realistic tissue).
And that is not acceptable. Our goal thus is to provide an alternative
specification with the following properties:
</p>
<ul><li>
    It has negligible memory requirements compared to the size of the tissue.
</li><li>
    It still allow us to specify desired network properties of the tissue.
</li><li>
    We can construct algorithms which can efficiently interconnect cells
    in the tissue according to the specification.
</li></ul>
<p>
Our solution splits the whole problem into a sequence of three sub-problems.
First, we interconnect only cells appearing in the same column. Then
we spread synapses from original cells to cells in other columns. And we
finish by setting up delimiters of migration lists for each cells in the tissue.
These three parts are described in details in the following three sections.
</p>
<h2>Set-up of synapses in column</h2>
<p>
Each column in a neural tissue has exactly the same structure. We can thus apply
the same set-up procedure for each column. In the following we describe the procedure
for a column at given tissue coordinates (<i>x,y</i>). Let us see a structure of the
column along the columnar axis.
</p>
<img src="./column_and_sensory_cells.svg" alt="[column_and_sensory_cells.svg]">
<p>
We see <i>K</i> kinds of tissue cells. <i>i</i>-th kind has exactly
<i>N<sub>i</sub></i> cells. Each cell of <i>i</i>-th kind has a territory for exactly
<i>T<sub>i</sub></i> synapses. We further see in the picture the mapping of sensory cells
to their coordinates along the columnar axis. There are <i>S</i> kinds of sensory cells
and <i>i</i>-th kind has exactly <i>N<sub>i</sub></i> sensory cells.
</p><p>
Each synapse is associated with tissue coordinates of its source cell (projecting the axon).
Our goal is to set-up coordinates to source cells of each synapse in the territory of each cell
in the column. Note that all these coordinates may differ only in the third coordinate (i.e.
along the columnar axis).
<!--</p><p>-->
<!--We need to specify for each tissue or sensory cell of a kind-->
<!--0 &le; <i>j</i> &lt; <i>K+S</i>-->
<!--how many synapses it projects into a tissue cell of a kind-->
<!--0 &le; <i>i</i> &lt; <i>K</i>.-->
</p><p>
Ideally we should specify for each tissue and sensory cell how many synapses it
projects into what tissue cell. Nevertheless, the size of this specification depends
on the length of the columnar axis of the tissue, i.e. it can be large
(<i>C&times;C<sub>S</sub></i> records). We thus propose a different specification,
where we focus on <em>kinds</em> of cell instead of individual cells.
Namely, for each kind of tissue cells
0 &le; <i>i</i> &lt; <i>K</i>
and for each kind of tissue or sensory cells
0 &le; <i>j</i> &lt; <i>K+S</i>
we specify a number
<i>a<sub>i,j</sub></i>
of synapses which are projected from <em>each</em> cell of the kind <i>j</i> to
<em>each</em> cell of the kind <i>i</i>. We can put all the numbers
<i>a<sub>i,j</sub></i>
into a matrix <i>A</i> of dimensions <i>K&times;(K+S)</i>:
</p>
<img src="./column_fill_matrix.svg" alt="[column_fill_matrix.svg]">
<p>
For each
0 &le; <i>i</i> &lt; <i>K</i>
the matrix <i>A</i> must satisfy
<i>T<sub>i</sub>N<sub>i</sub></i> =
&sum;<sub>j=0..(<i>K+S</i>-1)</sub> <i>a<sub>i,j</sub>N<sub>j</sub></i>.

We provide and approach which is inspired in the <em>tiling plane</em> [1].
