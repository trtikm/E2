<h1>E2: cellconnect</h1>
<p>
This module provides algorithms which are able to <em>set-up</em> synapses between cells in
a neural tissue s.t. the resulting tissue has some desired <em>network properties</em>.
It means that here we consider a neural tissue to be a network (graph) with cells
representing nodes and synapses representing links (edges). A network property is
then any property we can tell about a network from the point of view of the graph/network
theory. Here we primarily focus on the following very important
network properties: small-world property, power-law distribution of in/out-degrees
of cells (i.e. is the network scale-free), and clustering coefficients of cells.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Number of cells in a neural tissue can be quite large. An exact specification of
connections between cells requires a space comparable with the size of the tissue
itself (remember that number of synapses is dominant in any realistic tissue).
And that is not acceptable. Our goal thus is to provide an alternative
specification with the following properties:
</p>
<ul><li>
    It has negligible memory requirements compared to the size of the tissue.
</li><li>
    It still allow us to specify desired network properties of the tissue.
</li><li>
    We can construct algorithms which can efficiently interconnect cells
    in the tissue according to the specification.
</li></ul>
<p>
Our solution splits the whole problem into a sequence of two sub-problems.
First, we interconnect only cells appearing in the same column. And then
we spread synapses from original cells to cells in other columns.
These two steps are described in details in the following two sections.
</p>
<h2>Set-up of synapses in column</h2>
<h2>Spreading synapses amongst columns</h2>
<p>
We provide and approach which is inspired in the <em>tiling plane</em> [1].
