<!--<kbd style="color:red">TODO</kbd>-->
This library defines a parametrised model of a mammalian cerebral cortex
[<a href="./cellab.html#r01">1</a>] called <em>neural tissue</em> in the whole E2
project. Instances of the model (for given parameters) are primary subjects of the
study in this project. A <em>parameter</em> of the neural tissue is any datum passed
to any library function constructing the model in the memory or any algorithm
passed to any library function performing a simulation step.
</p>
<h2 id="neural_tissue">Structure of neural tissue</h2>
<p>
Here we specify what components the neural tissue is made of, what is their internal
structure and purpose, and how they are organised in 3D space. The basic structure
of the neural tissue is depicted in this picture.
</p>

     alt="[tissue_layout.svg]">
<p>
We see three main components of the model: <em>tissue</em>, <em>sensory cells</em>,
and <em>synapses to muscles</em>. The tissue is the component of the model where
the main computation is performed. Sensory cells and synapses to muscles
allow for information exchange between the tissue and an external <i>environment</i>
which is <i>not</i> a part of the model (see the library
<a href="../envlab/envlab.html">envlab</a>
for more information). We describe all tree components of the model in more details
in the following subsections.
</p>
<h3 id="tissue">Tissue</h3>
<p>
The tissue is a 2D array of <em>columns</em>.
There is <i>X</i> columns along the X axis and <i>Y</i> columns along the Y axis.
Valid indices to the array belong to the set
{0,&hellip;,<i>X</i>&minus;1}&times;{0,&hellip;,<i>Y</i>&minus;1}.
All columns in the tissue have the identical structure. Each column consists of
<i>C</i> <i>territories</i> aligned along the <i>columnar</i> axis C.
Each territory is uniquely identified in its column by a columnar
coordinate taken from the set {0,&hellip;,<i>C</i>&minus;1}. Moreover,
a territory  is uniquely identified in the whole issue by three coordinates
along the axes X, Y, and C. Territories are thus regularly distributed in the
<em>left-handed</em> 3D Cartesian space
[<a href="./cellab.html#r02">2</a>].
We discuss the structure of a column and a territory in a
<a href="./cellab.html#structure_of_column">separate section</a>
later. For now
it is sufficient to say that the model allows to split territories in a column
into <i>K</i> different <i>kinds</i> {0,&hellip;,<i>K</i>&minus;1}. We can see
in the picture that first <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> territories in each column are
of the kind 0, next <i>N</i><sub>1</sub> territories are of the kind 1, and so on.
Observe that
<i>C</i> = <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>&minus;1</sub>.
The model does <em>not</em> define interpretations of kinds.
This is left for parametrisations of the model. For example, a parametrisation
may interpret a kind as an identifier of an algorithm simulating certain behavior
of a component inside a territory of that kind.
</p>
<h3 id="sensory_cells">Sensory cells</h3>
<p>
Sensory cells allows for delivery of information form an external environment
to the tissue. They are split into <i>S</i> different
<i>sensory kinds</i> {0,&hellip;,<i>S</i>&minus;1}. The model does <em>not</em> define
interpretations of these kinds. This is left for parametrisations of the model.
For example, a parametrisation may interpret a kind as an assignment of sensory cells
(of that kind) to particular sense organs like eye, ear, nose, etc. Both sense
organs and even the process of encoding of information captured by senses into
the corresponding sensory cells are <i>not</i> parts of the model. They all belong
to the environment.
</p><p>
Due to purely technical reasons (which will be presented later
<kbd style="color:red">here</kbd>)
we align sensory cells
with the columnar axis C of the tissue. It means that each sensory cell has a unique
coordinate along the axis. We can see in the picture that the first sensory cell
(depicted at the top) is associated with the first free coordinate <i>C</i> along
the axis (the columnar axis is depicted on the left of the list of the sensory cells).
Note though that sensory cells do <em>not</em> have coordinates along X and Y axes
of the tissue.
</p><p>
Observe further that the number of sensory cell of a sensory kind
<i>i</i> is represented by a number <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+<i>i</i></sub>. This
notation follows from the technicals reasons mentioned above.  It allows us to
encapsulate both kinds of cells (tissue and sensory) and their counts under one
representation accessed using a single mechanism. The last sensory cell (depicted
at the bottom) is assigned the highest valid coordinate <i>C</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>
along the columnar axis C. Clearly,
<i>C</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>
    = <i>C</i> + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+0</sub> + &hellip;
        + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+<i>S</i>&minus;1</sub>
    = <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+<i>S</i>&minus;1</sub>.
</p><p>
Despite of division of sensory cells according to kinds, they are still
organised in one (long) list of cells as depicted in the picture from the top down.
Therefore, we can also identify individual sensory cells by their index (ordinal number)
in the list. The cell at the top has the index 0 and the cell at the bottom has the
index <i>C</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>&minus;<i>C</i>&minus;1.
</p>
<h3 id="synapses_to_muscles">Synapses to muscles</h3>
<p>
Synapses to muscles allows for delivery of information form the tissue to an external
environment. They are split into <i>U</i> different <i>kinds</i>
{0,&hellip;,<i>U</i>&minus;1}. The model does <em>not</em> define interpretations
of these kinds. This is left for parametrisations of the model. For example,
a parametrisation may interpret a kind as an assignment of synapses (of that kind)
to a particular muscle like biceps, triceps, etc. Neither muscles, the process of
decoding of information stored in the synapses, nor updating the environment
according to an effect of the decoded information on corresponding muscles
are <i>not</i> parts of the model. They all belong to the environment.
</p><p>
We can see in the picture above the number of synapses to muscles of a muscle
kind <i>i</i> is represented by a number <i>M</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>. The total
number of synapses to muscles in the model is thus
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>M</i><sub><i>U</i>&minus;1</sub>.
</p><p>
Despite of division of synapses to muscles according to kinds, they are still
organised in one (long) list as depicted in the picture from the top down.
We thus identify them by indices (ordinals) in the list. The synapse
at the top has the index 0 and the synapse at the bottom has the
index <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>M</i><sub><i>U</i>&minus;1</sub> &minus; 1.
