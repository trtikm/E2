<h1>E2: cellab</h1>
<p>
<!--<kbd style="color:red">TODO</kbd>-->
This library defines a parametrised model of mammalian cerebral cortex
[<a href="./cellab.html#r01">1</a>] called <em>neural tissue</em> in whole E2 project.
Instances of the model (for given parameters) are primary subjects of study in this project.
A <em>parameter</em> of the neural tissue is any datum passed to any library
function constructing the model in the memory or or any algorithm passed to any library
function performing a simulation step.

<h2 id="neural_tissue">Structure of neural tissue</h2>
<p>
Here we specify what components the neural tissue is made of, what is their internal
structure and purpose, and how they are organised in 3D space. The basic structure
of the neural tissue is depicted in this picture.

We see three main components of the model: <em>tissue</em>, <em>sensory cells</em>,
and <em>synapses to muscles</em>. The tissue is a 2D array of <em>columns</em>.
There is <i>X</i> columns along the X axis and <i>Y</i> columns along the Y axis.
Valid indices to the array represent the set
{0,&hellip;,<i>X</i>&minus;1}&times;{0,&hellip;,<i>Y</i>&minus;1}.
All columns in the tissue have identical structure. Each column thus contains exactly
the same count <i>C</i> of <i>tissue cells</i>. Due to clarity of the picture these
cells are not depicted in the picture. Nevertheless, they are aligned along the
<i>columnar</i> axis C. A tissue cell is uniquely identified in its column by its
columnar coordinate which from the set {0,&hellip;,<i>C</i>&minus;1}. A tissue cell
is uniquely identified in the issue by three coordinates along the axes X,Y, and C.
In other words, tissue cells are regularly distributed in the <em>left-handed</em>
3D Cartesian space
[<a href="./cellab.html#r02">2</a>].
The model allows to split tissue cells in a column into <i>K</i> different
<i>kinds</i> {0,&hellip;,<i>K</i>&minus;1}. We can see in the picture that
first <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> tissue cells in each column are of the kind 0, next
<i>N</i><sub>1</sub> tissue cells are of the kind 1, and so on.
Observe that
<i>C</i> = <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>&minus;1</sub>.
The model does <em>not</em> define interpretations of kinds of tissue cells.
This is left for a user of the model. For example, a user may interpret a kind
as an identifier of an algorithm simulating certain behavioral property of a cell.
The structure of a column is actually more complex than described so far. We provide
a detailed description later.
