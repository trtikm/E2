<h1>E2: cellab</h1>
<p>
<!--<kbd style="color:red">TODO</kbd>-->
This library defines a parametrised model of a mammalian cerebral cortex
[<a href="./cellab.html#r01">1</a>] called <em>neural tissue</em> in the whole E2
project. Instances of the model (for given parameters) are primary subjects of the
study in this project. A <em>parameter</em> of the neural tissue is any datum passed
to any library function constructing the model in the memory or any algorithm
passed to any library function performing a simulation step.
</p>
<h2 id="neural_tissue">Structure of neural tissue</h2>
<p>
Here we specify what components the neural tissue is made of, what is their internal
structure and purpose, and how they are organised in 3D space. The basic structure
of the neural tissue is depicted in this picture.
</p>
<img src="./tissue_layout.svg"
     alt="[tissue_layout.svg]">
<p>
We see three main components of the model: <em>tissue</em>, <em>sensory cells</em>,
and <em>synapses to muscles</em>. The tissue is the component of the model where
the main computation is performed. Sensory cells and synapses to muscles
allow for information exchange between the tissue and an external environment
(surrounding the whole model). Namely, sensory cells allows for receiving information
from the environment, while synapses to muscles allows for sending information from
the tissue to the environment. We describe all tree components of the model in
more details in the following three subsections.
</p>
<h3 id="tissue">Tissue</h3>
<p>
The tissue is a 2D array of <em>columns</em>.
There is <i>X</i> columns along the X axis and <i>Y</i> columns along the Y axis.
Valid indices to the array represent the set
{0,&hellip;,<i>X</i>&minus;1}&times;{0,&hellip;,<i>Y</i>&minus;1}.
All columns in the tissue have identical structure. Each column thus contains exactly
the same count <i>C</i> of <i>tissue cells</i>. Due to clarity of the picture these
cells are not depicted in the picture. Nevertheless, they are aligned along the
<i>columnar</i> axis C. A tissue cell is uniquely identified in its column by its
columnar coordinate taken from the set {0,&hellip;,<i>C</i>&minus;1}. A tissue cell
is uniquely identified in the issue by three coordinates along the axes X, Y, and C.
In other words, tissue cells are regularly distributed in the <em>left-handed</em>
3D Cartesian space
[<a href="./cellab.html#r02">2</a>].
The model allows to split tissue cells in a column into <i>K</i> different
<i>kinds</i> {0,&hellip;,<i>K</i>&minus;1}. We can see in the picture that
first <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> tissue cells in each column are of the kind 0, next
<i>N</i><sub>1</sub> tissue cells are of the kind 1, and so on.
Observe that
<i>C</i> = <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>&minus;1</sub>.
The model does <em>not</em> define interpretations of kinds.
This is left for a user of the model. For example, the user may interpret a kind
as an identifier of an algorithm simulating certain behavioral property of a cell.
<!--The structure of a column is actually more complex than described so far. We provide-->
<!--a detailed description later.-->
</p>
<h3 id="sensory_cells">Sensory cells</h3>
<p>
Sensory cells allows for delivery of information form the external environment
to the tissue. They are split into <i>S</i> different
<i>sensory kinds</i> {0,&hellip;,<i>S</i>&minus;1}. The model does <em>not</em> define
interpretations of these kinds. This is left for a user of the model. For example,
the user may interpret them as an assignment of sensory cells to particular sense organs
like eye, ear, nose, etc. The user is responsible for encoding of information captured
by the organs in the corresponding sensory cells.
</p><p>
Due to purely technical reasons (which will be presented later
<kbd style="color:red">here</kbd>)
we align sensory cells
with the columnar axis C of the tissue. It means that each sensory cell has a unique
coordinate along the axis. We can see in the picture that the first sensory cell
(depicted at the top) is associated with the first free coordinate <i>C</i> along
the axis (the columnar axis is depicted on the left of the list of the sensory cells).
Note though that sensory cells do <em>not</em> have coordinates along X and Y axes
of the tissue.
</p><p>
Observe further that the number of sensory cell of a sensory kind
<i>i</i> is represented by a number <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+<i>i</i></sub>. This
notation follows from the technicals reasons mentioned above.  It allows us to
encapsulate both kinds of cells (tissue and sensory) and their counts under one
representation accessed using a single mechanism. The last sensory cell (depicted
at the bottom) is assigned the highest valid coordinate <i>C</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>
along the columnar axis C. Clearly,
<i>C</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>
    = <i>C</i> + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+0</sub> + &hellip;
        + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+<i>S</i>&minus;1</sub>
    = <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>N</i><sub><i>K</i>+<i>S</i>&minus;1</sub>.
</p>
<h3 id="synapses_to_muscles">Synapses to muscles</h3>
<p>
Synapses to muscles allows for delivery of information form the tissue to the external
environment. They are split into <i>U</i> different
<i>muscle kinds</i> {0,&hellip;,<i>U</i>&minus;1}. The model does <em>not</em> define
interpretations of these kinds. This is left for a user of the model. For example,
the user may interpret them as an assignment of synapses to particular muscles.
The user is responsible for decoding of information stored in the synapses and
updating the environment according to an effect of the received information
on corresponding muscles. Note that the update of the environment may have an effect
on sense organs which it turn implies a request for an update of sensory cells.
</p><p>
We can see in the picture above the number of synapses to muscles of a muscle
kind <i>i</i> is represented by a number <i>M</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>. The total
number of synapses to muscles in the model is thus
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub> + &hellip; + <i>M</i><sub><i>U</i>&minus;1</sub>.
